BORG colors
============

The Borg theme is mostly black and white, but there are several accent gray
colors, as well as a specific blue. These colors are noted here, for reference.

True Black: #000;

True White: #fff;

Blue: #007CBA;
  This color blue should be accessable on both a white background, and gray.

Backgroupd gray: #f7f7f7;
  This medium gray is used mainly as a background color. It's used on the
  full-width banners and behind views exposed filters.

Border Gray: #E8E6E5;
  This darker gray is used as a border color for the regions that have a
  background, and on form elements. It should replace the use of the more
  standard #ccc;
